Boundary element method (BEM) is a numerical method to solve contact mechanics problems of randomly rough surfaces, which include the long-range elastic interactions.
Here, BEM is implemented as a regularized continuous quadratic program.
Derivations of the optimization problem are given.
Effect of regularization coefficients and different optimization solver on optimizing results are discussed. 
Fourier filetering method for generating randomly rough surfaces are also impelmented.
